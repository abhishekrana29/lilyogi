     In a world which is changing so rapidly where everything is so instant and fast, do you feel the children today are also losing out on patience and persistence. Fickle mindedness is considered as one of the biggest problem of the new generation. Lack of focus and will power, and easy access to the materialistic-world has made them less appreciative of the small pleasures of life.
<br/><br/>
Yoga helps in increasing focus and attention. Children by nature are restless but if they are taught how to concentrate and focus from an early age there is definitely hope that it stays with them through.
