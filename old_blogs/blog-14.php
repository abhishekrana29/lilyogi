     Anyone who has been practising yoga for sometime understands that , Yoga is more than a series of certain movements; yoga is a way of life.
<br/><br/>
A way of life emphasizing what is important; humility, grace, kindness, breathe, honoring your body, hope, change, stillness; through a series of movements. The movements are the vessels that carry this belief system through every inch of the body. 
<br/><br/>
It took me 9 years to realise that Yoga is a time-released drug that provides benefits keeps you feeling good long after the final Namaste has been spoken.
<br/><br/>
It is the only way to give back to something that gives so much. What does yoga mean to you?
