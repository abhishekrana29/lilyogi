     Where there is faith, there is no fear!!Yoga is the world’s oldest self-help technique, and, when used correctly, it is a system that empowers us to manage our well-being in many ways, including the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual parts of ourselves. Yoga requires courage as it is about transforming our will power, (which is the realm of the ego,) into quality courage. This stems from our higher self and consequently requires us to surrender to a power that is bigger than us.
