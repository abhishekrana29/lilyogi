     Gratitude is one of the trickiest concepts to teach toddlers and preschoolers, who are by nature self centered. Sure, thankful children are more polite and pleasant to be around, but there more to it than that. By learning gratitude, they become sensitive to the feelings of others, developing empathy and other life skills along the way.
<br><br>
We at Li’l Yogis help you in instilling grateful feelings in your child through asanas, stories and other yoga based games, which will benefit your child later in life.
