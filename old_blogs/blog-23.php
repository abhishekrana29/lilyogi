     As a Yoga teacher, classroom teacher, and mom, I feel particularly responsible for raising grateful children. Aparigraha is a Sanskrit term meaning “greedlessness” or “gratitude”, and it is one of the basic teachings of Yoga. This doesn’t mean simply saying “Thank you”, although manners are very important. My goal for my kids it to encourage and inspire genuine gratitude to the people and situations that allow them to be who they are and enjoy what they have. When we look for the good, we see all that we have to be grateful for. When we have things to be grateful for, we give thanks. 🙏🏻
