     Knowing how to cope with stress is a critical life skill. If our kids can learn how to calm down and think clearly while under stress, they will have a much better chance of leading successful and happy lives. 
<br><br>
Any physical exercise releases endorphins, which reduces your brains perception of pain. In today’s world kids are hooked on to the digital world and gadget, which in turn reduces there physical activity.
<br><br>
We at Li’l Yogis help give your child an open air studio where children do yoga in natural air and light. Our class doesn’t only concentrate on asanas but also help teach life skills and values.
